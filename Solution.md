### ✅ Frontend: SOLUTION
```markdown
# RecipeShare Frontend – Solution Overview
## Architecture Overview
The frontend uses **Angular 16+ standalone components** for a streamlined, modular approach. Each component manages a distinct UI responsibility, and services handle HTTP logic.
### Components
- `RecipeListComponent`: Lists all recipes, includes search box
- `RecipeFormComponent`: Reused for both add and edit views
- `RecipeService`: Handles API interaction
- `RecipeDTO`: Shared model between UI and backend
---
## Trade-Offs
| Trade-Off | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Standalone components vs NgModules | Chose standalone components to simplify code and reduce boilerplate |
| No pagination | Focused on core functionality; can be added easily later |
| No UI library | Custom CSS for lightweight and clean UI |
| Toasts and modals | Skipped for this version; could be added with Angular Material |

## Security & Validation
- Client-side validation using Angular Reactive Forms
- Backend handles server-side validation
- No authentication implemented yet (assumed public for this demo)
---
## Monitoring & Error Handling
- Console logging for development
- HTTP error handling with user-friendly fallback messages (to be added)
- Future enhancement: add toast notifications for feedback
---
## Cost Efficiency
- Fully static frontend – can be hosted for free using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Azure Static Web Apps
- Minimal dependencies for a smaller bundle size
- Uses Angular CLI build optimizer and lazy loading support
---
## Summary
The frontend is lightweight, responsive, and built with modern Angular features. It’s well-organized, easy to extend, and integrates cleanly with the backend API.
